## Instructions

Welcome! As part of the interview process for the Support Specialist role at Mintlify, we'd like to assess how you communicate with customers in various situations.

Below are **4 real-world customer scenarios** that our support team encounters. Some customers may be frustrated, confused, or pressed for time. Your task is to:

1. **Read each customer message carefully**
2. **Draft a response directly in this document** (in the "Your Response" section below each scenario)
3. **Be helpful, empathetic, and professional**
4. **Include any relevant next steps or resources**
5. **Maintain Mintlify's friendly and technical tone**

<Note>
  There are no "trick questions" here. We're looking for clear communication, empathy, problem-solving skills, and the ability to remain professional under pressure.
</Note>

<Tip>
  **To complete this exercise:** Edit this MDX file directly, add your responses below each scenario, and submit the edited file back to your hiring manager.
</Tip>

## Scenario 1: Frustrated Customer - Build Failure

**Subject:** Build failing AGAIN and it's blocking our launch

> This is ridiculous. My docs build has been failing for the past 2 hours and I've tried everything. Our product launches tomorrow and we need the docs live NOW. Why is this so unreliable?? I followed your quickstart guide exactly.
>
> Error: `Failed to build: Invalid navigation structure in docs.json`
>
> I don't have time to debug this myself. Please fix this ASAP.
>
> - Alex Chen, CTO at TechStart

## Scenario 2: Confused New User

**Subject:** How do I make a page?

> Hi,
>
> I just signed up for Mintlify and I'm completely lost. I see files in my repo but I don't know where to start. The dashboard just shows deployment status. How do I actually create a new documentation page?
>
> I'm not super technical so please explain it simply if possible.
>
> Thanks,
> Sarah

## Scenario 3: Aggressive Technical User

**Subject:** Your MDX parser is broken

> Your MDX parser is completely broken. I'm using a custom React component in my docs and it just renders as plain text. I've used MDX in Next.js projects before and this works fine everywhere else.
>
> Here's my component:
> ```jsx
> <CustomAlert type="warning">Important notice</CustomAlert>
> ```
>
> This is basic MDX functionality. Did you even test this before releasing it? I'm paying for this service and it doesn't work. Either fix your parser or I'm switching to Docusaurus.

## Scenario 4: Angry About Downtime

**Subject:** Unacceptable downtime

> Our docs have been down for 15 minutes. This is UNACCEPTABLE for a paid service. We have customers trying to access our API documentation right now and they're getting 404 errors.
>
> This makes US look unprofessional. What's your SLA? Where's the status page? Why weren't we notified? I need answers NOW.
>
> - Jennifer Park, VP of Engineering
